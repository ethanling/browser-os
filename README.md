# BrowserOS 

This project is actively developed (for fun) by [Ethan Ling](htt[s://ethanling.com]).

## Motivation 

I started building this application as a means to develop skills using React and TailwindCSS. Though not particularly useful, building an OS environment inside the browser appealed to me in terms of creating a complex UI that was not a simple CRUD app.

## Tech Stack
Frontend:
* React
* Tailwind
* React Router 
* Framer Motion for animations
* FontAwesome for icons

Backend:
* TBD
